              King County, WA was the first the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States,
              and the disease appears to be spreading rapidly across the region and beyond. The purpose of this
              research is to understand how an outbreak such as this affect our mental and social well-being and
              how these in turn influence our own behavioral response. We are recruiting adults (18+) who currently
              live in King County, WA to participate in this research. Participants took a brief (3 minute)
              survey on their smart phones every evening for 2.5 months, where they will be asked about their emotional,
              behavioral, and social responses to COVID-19.

                Although frequently hypothesized, the evidence for associations between affect and marijuana use in everyday life remains ambiguous. Inconsistent findings across existing work may be due, in part, to differences in study design and analytic decisions, such as study inclusion criteria, the operationalization of affect, or the timing of affect assessment. We used specification curves to assess the robustness of the evidence for affect predicting same-day marijuana use and marijuana use predicting next-day affect across several hundred models that varied in terms of decisions that reflect those typical in this literature (e.g., whether to average affect prior to marijuana use or select the affect report closest in time to marijuana use). We fitted these curves to data from two ecological momentary assessment studies of regular marijuana and/or alcohol using college students (N = 287). Results provided robust evidence that marijuana use was slightly less likely following experiences of negative affect and slightly more likely following positive affect. Specification curves suggested that differences in previous findings are most likely a function of the specific emotion items used to represent affect rather than differences in inclusion criteria, the temporal assessment and modeling of affect, or the covariates added to the model. There was little evidence for an association between marijuana use and next-day affect. Overall, our findings provide evidence against the predictions made by affect reinforcement models in college students and suggest that future research should model the associations of marijuana use with discrete emotional states rather than general negative and positive affect.

                Influential psychological theories hypothesize that people consume alcohol in response to the experience of both negative and positive emotions. Despite two decades of daily diary and ecological momentary assessment research, it remains unclear whether people consume more alcohol on days they experience higher negative and positive affects in everyday life. In this preregistered meta-analysis, we synthesized the evidence for these daily associations between affect and alcohol use. We included individual participant data from 69 studies (N = 12,394), which used daily and momentary surveys to assess the affect and the number of alcoholic drinks consumed. Results indicate that people are not more likely to drink on days they experience high negative affect but are more likely to drink and drink heavily on days high in positive affect. People self-reporting a motivational tendency to drink-to-cope and drink-to-enhance consumed more alcohol but not on days they experienced higher negative and positive affects. Results were robust across different operationalizations of affect, study designs, study populations, and individual characteristics. These findings challenge the long-held belief that people drink more alcohol following increase in negative affect. Integrating these findings under different theoretical models and limitations of this field of research, we collectively propose an agenda for future research to explore open questions surrounding affect and alcohol use.

              <span class="abstract">
                Influential theoretical models hypothesize that alcohol use is an especially potent reinforcer when used as a strategy
                to cope with negative affect. Although the evidence for this idea in observational data is weak, some experimental evidence
                suggests that the behavioral economic demand for alcohol increases immediately following a negative emotional event.
                Because existing studies testing the effect of negative mood inductions on the demand for alcohol have several methodological
                limitations and do not take inter- and intraindividual variability into account, we developed an improved experimental design
                to increase our confidence in any potential within-person effect of negative mood inductions on alcohol demand as well as to
                test whether this effect exhibits systematic inter- and intraindividual variability. We hypothesize that people will show a
                higher demand for alcohol following negative compared to neutral mood inductions and that this effect is stronger in heavy
                compared to light drinkers as well as stronger on days characterized by higher coping motives and negative urgency. Three
                hundred twenty college students will complete the alcohol purchase task (APT) after being subjected to 100 mood inductions
                (six negative, six neutral) on 20 separate days

                Concerns about the possible effects of social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted several gaps in our knowledge 
                about the association between social interactions and mental health. The current study aimed to characterize the unique effect of 
                social interaction quantity and quality on daily depressed mood and loneliness and to identify the degree to which these processes 
                operate at the within-person and between-person levels of analysis. A community sample of 515 adults was recruited to participate in 
                75 days of daily surveys. Participants reported on daily feelings of loneliness, depressed mood, social interaction frequency, engagement 
                in vulnerable self-disclosure, and perceived responsiveness. Linear mixed models were used to identify the effect of daily social interaction 
                quantity and quality on loneliness and depressed mood and to characterize the degree to which these effects varied across individuals. Social 
                interaction quantity and perceived responsiveness were negatively associated with depressed mood and loneliness at the within-person level 
                of analysis. Perceived responsiveness was also negatively associated with depressed mood and loneliness at both the within-person and 
                between-person levels of analysis. Random slopes analysis revealed substantial heterogeneity in the within-person effects. The non-experimental 
                design of this study precludes drawing causal conclusions. Furthermore, demographic and/or geographic differences in the observed effects may limit 
                generalization. Engaging in more frequent, high-quality interactions may protect against daily depressed mood and loneliness despite one’s 
                average level of these variables. Future research is needed to establish causality and identify the degree to which these findings generalize 
                across samples and time.

                Effective, scalable interventions to address depression and loneliness and improve the quality of social 
                relationships are needed for public health in pandemic and non-pandemic contexts. Towards this end, a randomized, controlled trial tested 
                a mobile-based intervention, derived from social psychological and relationship science, for improving relational well-being and decreasing 
                depression and loneliness. Participants were randomly assigned to either intervention (n = 719) or assessment only (n = 701) conditions and 
                completed daily diary surveys for 28 days in the midst of the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. In the middle 14 days of the study, 
                intervention participants received daily text-message suggestions for improving relational and mental well-being. Results indicated that 
                the intervention decreased depression and loneliness and improved relationships during the intervention 
                period but these changes were not sustained when the intervention ceased. Discussion: Results are encouraging in that evidence-based 
                suggestions can be scaled effectively but additional efforts are required to sustain improvements over time.

                B enacts a response, and Person A perceives the response as responsive, we present an integrative, analytic-abstractive, 
                contextual-behavioral model of intimate relations. The model describes the intimacy process as a set of functional relations 
                describing behaviors and responses of Persons A and B in context, languaged as middle-level terms to facilitate cross-disciplinary 
                applications. Three primary relations of the model are non-verbal emotional expression (Person A) and safety (Person B), verbal 
                self-disclosure (Person A) and validation (Person B), and asking (Person A) and giving (Person B). The model also emphasizes 
                the importance of self- and other-awareness, expressions of closeness, and reciprocity as additional terms. Future research 
                directions and potential applications are discussed.

                Previous research on microaggressions has emphasized the frequency of and distress produced by microaggressions as reported by people of color.
                The current research supplements the existing literature by developing a self-report measure of White individuals’ microaggressive likelihood 
                against Black people, the Cultural Cognitions and Actions Scale (CCAS). Study 1 developed the CCAS through exploratory and confirmatory factor 
                analyses of responses to CCAS items from a sample of 978 non-Hispanic White undergraduate students. The final scale comprised four factors 
                (Negative Attitudes, Colorblindness, Objectifying, and Avoidance) assessing microaggressive likelihood, and CCAS total and factor scores were 
                significantly related to several other indicators of racism and bias. Study 2 involved 31 of the previous participants in a lab-based discussion 
                of race-related issues with a confederate and provided initial support for the predictive validity of the measure. Overall, this report supports a 
                growing literature that microaggressions are more than innocuous, harmless behaviors, unrelated to racism, and instead represent relevant processes 
                within the science of racism and bias. It also provides a potential means of testing the effectiveness of interventions intended to reduce the 
                commission of microaggressions.

                Background: Racial bias in medical care is a significant public health issue, with increased focus on microaggressions
                and the quality of patient-provider interactions. Innovations in training interventions are needed to decrease microaggressions
                and improve provider communication and rapport with patients of color during medical encounters. Methods: This paper presents a
                pilot randomized trial of an innovative clinical workshop that employed a theoretical model from social and contextual behavioral
                sciences. The intervention specifically aimed to decrease providers’ likelihood of expressing biases and negative stereotypes when
                interacting with patients of color in racially charged moments, such as when patients discuss past incidents of discrimination.
                Workshop exercises were informed by research on the importance of mindfulness and interracial contact involving reciprocal exchanges
                of vulnerability and responsiveness. Twenty-five medical student and recent graduate participants were randomized to a workshop
                intervention or no intervention. Outcomes were measured via provider self-report and observed changes in targeted provider behaviors.
                Specifically, two independent, blind teams of coders assessed provider emotional rapport and responsiveness during simulated interracial
                patient encounters with standardized Black patients who presented specific racial challenges to participants. Results: Greater improvements
                in observed emotional rapport and responsiveness (indexing fewer microaggressions), improved self-reported explicit attitudes toward minoritized
                groups, and improved self-reported working alliance and closeness with the Black standardized patients were observed and reported by intervention
                participants. Conclusions: Medical providers may be more likely to exhibit bias with patients of color in specific racially charged moments
                during medical encounters. This small-sample pilot study suggests that interventions that directly intervene to help providers improve
                responding in these moments by incorporating mindfulness and interracial contact may be beneficial in reducing racial health disparities.

              <span class="abstract">
                The interpersonal process model (IPM) suggests that closeness develops in relationships when two people reciprocally
                engage in vulnerable self-disclosure, respond to each other, and perceive each other’s responses as validating, understanding,
                and caring (responsive). Little is known about how fear-of-intimacy relates to this foundational intimacy process. We conducted
                two studies of fear-of-intimacy and the IPM. In Study 1, 146 high fear-of-intimacy participants were randomly assigned to either
                interact for 1 hr with a research assistant (RA) demonstrating high responsiveness, to interact for 1 hr with an RA displaying low
                responsiveness, or to view a nature video for 1 hr. Unlike previous experiments with undergraduates documenting that high responsiveness
                predicts closeness up to 2 weeks after the interaction, the current study with high fear-of-intimacy individuals found that high
                responsiveness predicted closeness immediately after the interaction but this was not sustained over time. In Study 2, we conducted
                structural modeling in a diverse sample of 216 survey respondents with a range of fear-of-intimacy scores. Consistent with previous
                studies, perceived responsiveness strongly predicted closeness. Fear-of-intimacy had negative direct effects on vulnerable self-disclosure
                and perceived responsiveness but a positive direct effect on closeness.

                Humans are fundamentally social beings, and the relationships we form with others are crucial for our well-being.
                Research across a variety of domains has established the association between a variety of interpersonal factors and
                health outcomes, including quality-of-life. However, there is a need for a more integrative, holistic analysis of these
                variables and how they relate to one another. Undergraduate students (<em>n</em> = 1456) from four universities across the United
                States completed self-report measures of their quality-of-life and a variety of interpersonal factors identified as important
                predictors across the literature. We examined zero-order correlations between these measures and quality-of-life, estimated
                a path model to look at unique variance accounted for by each, and finally used network analysis to examine the network of
                direct and indirect associations among these variables and quality-of-life. Loneliness had the strongest association with
                quality-of-life across all analyses. When examining the unique association between quality-of-life and each interpersonal
                variable, six remained statistically significant: loneliness, social support, social connectedness, emotional intelligence,
                intimacy with one&apos;s romantic partner, and empathic concern. These results were supported by the network model, which found
                direct associations between quality-of-life and these six variables as well as indirect associations with all other
                interpersonal variables in the model. Results from this research suggest that interpersonal factors in general, and
                loneliness in particular, are strongly associated with quality-of-life. Future research is needed to establish the
                direction of these effects and examine for whom these findings are generalizable.

                High quality relationships are essential to psychological health and well-being, and relational intimacy is a core
                model of intimacy wherein individuals develop close, trusting relationships with one another. Functional Analytic
                Psychotherapy (FAP) is a contextual behavioral intervention approach that is well-equipped to target inter-
                personal processes through the provision of in-session, therapist mediated reinforcement of skillful intimate
                relating. Single-subject level analyses of FAP&apos;s efficacy and mechanism of action are supportive; however, there
                is a need for group-level research to evaluate its efficacy and generalizability. This paper presents the devel-
                opment of the Awareness, Courage, and Responsiveness Scale (ACRS), a self-report measure of behaviors es-
                sential to intimate relating informed by contextual behavioral science principles and Reis and Shaver&apos;s (1988)
                Intimacy Process Model. In this five-part study, functioning of the ACRS is examined in undergraduate student
                samples (Studies 1–3), an adult community sample (Study 3), non-clinical dyadic relationships (Study 4), and a
                clinical sample (Study 5). Strengths and limitations of the final measure are discussed.

                Job burnout is a condition that interferes significantly with quality of life and is related to stressful working
                environments, organizational climate, and client outcomes. The introduction of burnout prevention and &quot;Helping the Helper&quot;
                programs may produce significant benefits with respect to this issue. In this study, we assessed a weekly online &quot;Helping
                the Helper&quot; intervention based on the behavioral principles of Functional Analytic Psychotherapy (FAP) to improve social
                relationships, reduce burnout, and improve organizational climate and quality of life in mental health professionals. Six
                therapists of the Borderline Personality Disorder Clinic of Mexico&apos;s National Institute of Psychiatry participated in this study.
                Subjects answered three questionnaires (Maslach Burnout Inventory, Multidimensional Scale of Organizational Climate, and World
                Health Organization Quality of Life - BREF) at seven time points throughout the duration of the study. The intervention was
                implemented between time points three and five. Robust Improvement Rate Difference (R-IRD) scores were computed for each subject
                to assess for the intervention&apos;s efficacy. Results suggest preliminary support for the possibility of a &quot;Helping the Helper&quot;
                intervention based on FAP for reducing burnout and improving organizational climate among colleagues in a high-stress, public
                mental health setting.

                describes a four-session intervention for increasing closeness in romantic and non-romantic dyads. Three key

                Objective: This article describes the development and preliminary psychometric evaluation of the Antisemitism-Related
                Stress Inventory (ARSI), a multidimensional measure of the frequency and impact of antisemitic experiences of American
                Jews. As the first known attempt to measure antisemitism-related stress, the ARSI represents a novel contribution in
                this area. Method: Adult, American Jewish respondents (<em>N</em> = 500) completed a battery of measures, including 87
                initial items for possible inclusion in the ARSI. An exploratory factor analysis determined the factor structure of and
                best items for inclusion in the final scale. Correlations with established measures of stress, satisfaction with life,
                self-esteem, and Jewish religious and cultural identity were computed to explore concurrent validity. Results: The final
                30-item ARSI included three subscales capturing Individual Experiences of antisemitism (14 items), Collective Experiences of
                antisemitism (11 items), and experiences related to one&apos;s Personal Safety (five items). The ARSI demonstrated strong internal
                consistency and concurrent validity with measures of stress and satisfaction with life. Jewish cultural identity predicted a
                higher frequency of collective experiences of anti-Semitism, whereas religious identity predicted fewer individual experiences
                of antisemitism. Conclusion: Findings support the ARSI as a promising measure to understand the impact of antisemitism on
                American Jews. These findings are discussed in regard to their specific implications for future research, including the need
                for further investigation into the impact of antisemitism on the psychological health and well-being of American Jews and
                complex relations with multiple aspects of Jewish identity.

                Functional Analytic Psychotherapy (FAP; Kohlenberg & Tsai, 1991) is a transdiagnostic approach to outpatient
                psychotherapy that presented guidelines to instantiate the behavioral principle of natural, social reinforcement
                applied to idiographic behavioral targets within a genuine and authentic psychotherapy relationship. We present
                the fi rst comprehensive review of research on FAP, including qualitative studies, uncontrolled and controlled
                single-case designs, group designs, and studies on training therapists in FAP. We conclude that current research
                support for FAP is promising but not suffi cient to justify claims that FAP is research-supported for specific
                psychiatric disorders. There is stronger support for FAP&apos;s mechanism of therapist-as-social reinforcer: FAP
                techniques, when appropriately applied to idiographically defi ned behavioral problems— primarily in the realm
                of social functioning — produce positive change in those behaviors.

                Previous efforts to understand microaggressions have surveyed stigmatized group members&apos; experiences of receiving
                microaggressions. This report presents the first attempt to measure self-reported likelihood of delivering
                microaggressions rather than receiving microaggressions and to explore the association between the likelihood of
                delivering microaggressions and racial prejudice. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 33 black and 118
                non-Hispanic white undergraduate students at a large public Southern/Midwest university. Black students reported
                the degree to which a series of statements would be experienced as microaggressive. White students reported their
                likelihood of delivering those statements and completed measures of racial prejudice. White students&apos; self-reported
                likelihood of engaging in microaggressive acts was significantly related to all measures of racial prejudice. The
                single item &quot;A lot of minorities are too sensitive&quot; was the strongest predictor of negative feelings toward
                black people. Results offer preliminary support that the delivery of microaggressions by white students is not simply
                innocuous behavior and may be indicative of broad, complex, and negative racial attitudes and explicit underlying
                hostility and negative feelings toward black students.

                The use of idiographically defined target behaviors in Functional Analytic Psychotherapy (FAP) has
                limited participation in a reticulated model of treatment development. One way to address this limitation
                is to offer a standardized set of clinical targets for FAP. The current study details a method of identifying
                standardized treatment targets in FAP using the Awareness, Courage, and Love (ACL) model. The applicability
                of the model was assessed by evaluating the degree to which previously identified clinical targets in FAP
                research correspond with the proposed specific categories of the ACL model. There is an 83.67% fit between
                past idiographic targets and current standardized targets. We discuss how ACL may be clinically useful and
                encourage more integrative treatment development for FAP.

              <span class="abstract">
                Functional Analytic Psychotherapy (FAP) is a contextual behavioral psychotherapy approach in which client behavior
                is shaped in the psychotherapy relationship and then generalized to out-of-session contexts. Efforts to train
                therapists in FAP have employed a parallel process, attempting to shape trainee behavior in an 8-week, live,
                online course in which trainees interact with each other in a series of experiential exercises. Previous research
                on the effects of this FAP training protocol have been hampered by reliance on trainee self-report and a lack of
                objective assessment of trainee behavior in actual sessions. In the current study, we developed and piloted an
                objective measure of FAP competency and employed it to assess outcomes in a FAP training study. Sixteen participants
                with a range of previous FAP training experiences were randomly assigned to an immediate FAP training or a
                waitlist-then-training group. Trainee self-report findings largely replicated findings from the previous study
                (Kanter, Tsai, Holman, & Koerner, 2012), with larger and more consistent effects found for trainees with fewer previous
                FAP training experiences. Objective assessment of in-session trainee behavior with the FAP Competency Scale suggested a
                significant effect of training, but these results were limited by missing data. These findings provide preliminary support
                for the hypothesis that engaging in a FAP training that functionally parallels the therapy process can enhance FAP therapist
                in-session competency.

                A therapeutic model of social connection derived from Functional Analytic Psychotherapy (FAP) that
                applies to both the client&apos;s outside-of-therapy relationships and the psychotherapeutic relationship is
                explored in two studies. The model integrates established behavioral principles with existing research on
                the reciprocal process of self-disclosure and responsiveness that occurs during development of intimate
                relationships to highlight a promising therapeutic process. In this process, self-disclosure (&quot;courage&quot; in
                FAP&apos;s model) is evoked by the therapist and then reinforced with therapeutic responsiveness (&quot;love&quot; in
                the FAP model) resulting in improved self-disclosure and more connectedness in the therapy and other
                relationships. Study 1 included a sample of 77 undergraduate participants who self-disclosed responses
                to a series of closeness generating questions to undergraduate research assistants trained in respon-
                siveness. Findings indicated that social connection increased following this full procedure. Study 2 included
                a sample of 99 undergraduate participants and provided evidence that the responsiveness of the
                research assistant is key to promoting increased feelings of connectedness and also improves the depth
                of disclosure.

                A brief, group mindfulness intervention targeting both state mindfulness and social connectedness was developed
                based on Functional Analytic Psychotherapy&apos;s model of awareness, courage, and love. A total of 114 college
                students were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) a nature video control, (2) a traditional
                intrapersonal mindfulness intervention focused on awareness of breath and private stimuli such as bodily
                sensations, thoughts, and feelings, or (3) an interpersonal mindfulness intervention that emphasized
                (a) expanding awareness from private internal to external public stimuli associated with the presence of
                others, (b) a contemplation of common humanity and risks participants could take to improve a specific
                relationship, and (c) a brief small group interaction involving courageous sharing of these risks. Results
                indicated significant benefits of all three conditions with respect to state mindfulness with both
                mindfulness conditions outperforming the nature video, and significant benefits of both mindfulness
                conditions with respect to social connectedness, with the interpersonal mindfulness condition outperforming
                the intrapersonal condition. Limitations include no follow-up data to explore the maintenance of gains over time.
